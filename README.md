| **Column**                  | **Details**                                                                       |  
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Year**                    | Randomized years between 2015 and 2025.                                          |  
| **Paper Cups Manufactured (million)** | Annual estimates between 800 and 1,500 million units.                            |  
| **CO₂ Emissions (tons)**    | Estimated yearly emissions between 200,000 and 400,000 tons.                     |  
| **Water Consumed (liters)**  | Annual water usage values from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 liters.                    |  
| **Recycled Waste (%)**      | Random yearly recycling percentages ranging from 15% to 50%.                     |  
| **Landfilled Waste (%)**    | Complementary values calculated as 100% - recycled percentage.                   |

## **Data Visualization Insights**  

### **1. Line Graph: Paper Cup Production vs. CO₂ Emissions**  
- **Goal:** Illustrate the direct link between manufacturing trends and emissions over time.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Increasing production leads to higher CO₂ emissions, highlighting the need for sustainable practices.  

### **2. Bar Graph: Annual Recycling vs. Landfill Contributions**  
- **Goal:** Contrast yearly recycling rates with landfill percentages.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Recycling shows steady progress, but significant waste still ends up in landfills, emphasizing the need for systemic changes.  

### **3. Waterfall Graph: Avoiding Paper Cups’ Environmental Benefits**  
- **Goal:** Highlight cumulative savings in CO₂ and water usage by reducing consumption.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Tangible benefits demonstrate the power of small behavioral shifts toward sustainability.  

### **4. Heatmap: Interdependencies Between Key Metrics**  
- **Goal:** Explore the correlations among production, emissions, and water usage.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Strong positive correlations underline the importance of curbing production to address related impacts.  

### **5. Pie Graph: Waste Management Trends Over Time**  
- **Goal:** Showcase the yearly split of waste into recycled and landfilled categories.  
- **Key Takeaway:** A snapshot of waste distribution underscores the need for better recycling technologies and awareness.
